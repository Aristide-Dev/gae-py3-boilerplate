# How to run the web app using run.py

The best way to run the web app is using the `run.py` file. There are two ways to do it:

### A) Right-click in PyCharm on the `run.py` file and select Run.

### B) Run in the terminal using `python run.py` (make sure you use Python 3).

The `run.py` script will ask you whether to run the web app or tests.

Alternatively, you can select app vs. tests already in the command line:

    python run.py app

or

    python run.py test
